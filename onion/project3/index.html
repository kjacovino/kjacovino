          <h3>What is it?</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="article">
          <p>The editorial dashboard was a way for users to customize what they see when they first log into Bulbs CMS. The default view had always been a list of all the articles, but the editorial staff, the finance staff, and the contributors had varying needs and wanted more useful information delivered quickly.</p>

          <h3>The Problem</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="article">
          <p>In particular, editorial staff including the community managers, wanted a way to quickly see analytics for how articles were faring as well as tracking how their content production was pacing. The finance team also wanted to see how the content pacing was going, but additionally, they wanted to be able to pull content production reports on the fly. Writers and contributors wanted quick access to their own articles (as the main list could be unruly) and an at-a-glance view of what was currently trending.</p>

          <h3>The Solution</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="article">
          <p>We wanted the dashboards to be customizable, but really focused on the needs of the different user types. For this, I came up with a bunch of different widgets that could be used on any of the dashboards, but that provided value to different types of users. This was also the beginning of integration for a notification system, so the ability to contact the editor/tech through the CMS was a new feature.</p>

          <p>Since we were going to be building in new functionality for tracking content production, I also worked with editorial to come up with a calendar view for their publishing schedule. The dashboards were part of a larger redesign/rethinking for Bulbs CMS, which never made it into production unfortunately, so you'll notice some widgets in the wireframes below went unfinished.</p>
