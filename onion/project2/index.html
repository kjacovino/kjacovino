          <h3>What is it?</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="article">
          <p>The editorial team has a number of contractors and freelancers that contribute content in various formats. Sometimes they contribute full articles, like on A.V. Club, and sometimes they contribute individual jokes or headlines, like on The Onion and ClickHole.</p>

          <h3>The Problem</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="article">
          <p>The editorial team was tracking all of this information through a series of spreadsheets and shared documents that various team members were contributing to. For instance, the editors would track who submitted a particular joke, what article it was part of, and then the managing editor would assign a payment amount to the contribution. At the end of the month, the managing editor would sum up each freelancer’s contributions, and it would be up to the freelancer to double check and make sure they were paid the right amount (while having no access to any of this documentation). It was an involved process to say the least, and one that we felt could be simplified and have fewer errors if it could be tracked in the CMS, edited directly when the article was being created, and everyone had the ability to pull their respective reports.</p>

          <h3>The Solution</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="article">
          <p>After working closely with the editorial staffs to learn how the process of tracking freelance contributions worked for each of our three sites, I was able to come up with a system that was integrated into our CMS to simplify and unify their processes.</p>

          <p>The solution for this was two part. First, we created a new tab on the article editing page to enter the contributions. This allowed the editor to enter the freelancer contributions while the article was being drafted, but was hidden from all individual contributors and writers.</p>

          <p>Second, we created a dashboard for the managing editor to track the freelance contributions. They could view and export the payments for each contractor based on the dates entered, and could view each contribution if there was a dispute. This simplified the process for paying contributors as well as eliminating the need for a series of shared spreadsheets that were prone to errors. We also added permissions so that freelancers could view their own contributions right in the CMS. As an added bonus, editorial and finance could also track production and cost per article against total page views through the reporting tools.</p>

          <p>The entire payment system was set up variably as well since the payment types for each of our sites were different. The managing editor could create various “roles” which had different methods of payment (e.g. a flat rate, hourly rate, based on a certain feature type, or they could set a rate manually for a certain role, or they could create a one-off payment as an added line item). This gave each of our managing editors more control over how payments were made since each site had different needs. The A.V. Club, for instance, had a lot of transcriptionists who were paid hourly, while TV Reviews and Great Job Internet each had different flat rates. There was also an option to override any pre-set role pricing for an individual contributor since certain contributors or reviewers had different contracts than the standard pricing. Using roles was a flexible way to accommodate all these different payment types.</p>
