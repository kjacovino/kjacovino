          <h3>Betty Cropper</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="article">
          <p>Betty was the image editing tool that was built into the CMS. I was tasked with improving the UX of the cropper as well as incorporating additional crop sizes for some new front-end layouts that were coming down the pipeline. After talking to the editors who were uploading the content, this was the workflow I came up with and was ultimately implemented.</p>

          <h3>Content Promotions</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="article">
          <p>Our community managers (essentially social media editors) were responsible for updating the promoted content on the front page of each website throughout the day. There was no method for scheduling these promotions&mdash;it was just a manual task that they were performing all day, sometimes even at midnight when new TV reviews were being published. They still wanted the control to promote content manually, but this system alleviated the stress (and sleep deprivation) that came with constantly interrupting what they're doing to promote a new piece of content.</p>

          <p>I also worked closely with the engineering team to understand how the system was going to recognize each operation and came up with a frontend UI for the user to see the operations at a glance and make changes directly there as needed.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="article">
          <p>We wanted to add a widget to the video content in the CMS that would show at a glance how the video was playing (heh) with audiences. In particular, we wanted to track quartile viewing. Sales and editorial both were interested in this data for different reasons.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="article">
          <p>We wanted a way to incorporate a new content feature into the CMS that was initially used for The A.V. Club's Summer Movie Preview, which prompted a simultaneous redesign the article lists and content editor for the CMS since it was insufficient for the new feature type (and needed a cleanup in general anyways).</p>

          <h3>CMS Quizzes</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="article">
          <p>ClickHole wanted to implement three new quiz types, so I worked with them to come up with wireframes for how they wanted each quiz to function and worked with engineering to make sure the data models and ‘grading’ systems would work accordingly. I also came up with a little UI element to help explain what each quiz was at a glance for the writers.</p>
