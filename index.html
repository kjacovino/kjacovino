          <p>Thanks for your interest in my work! This is a private portfolio of a selection of projects that I've worked on over the years. It's separate from my client facing website since some of the contents are proprietary. I would appreciate you not sharing this work publicly!</p>
          <p>Thanks, and enjoy!<br>

          <h3>About Me</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="article">
          <p>I'm a product designer and tech nerd consultant with a focus on user experience, holistic design approaches, and realistic solution implementation. I was previously UX Architect at LimeRed Studio, and more recently UX/UI Designer at The Onion. I've been consulting full time for the last three years, and seeing my clients' eyes light up when they realize how much time they're going to save is what keeps me going! I like to fancy myself a great communicator, an avid listener, and someone who never stops learning—though tbh, I don't like to fancy myself much in general.. I just don't have the ego.</p>

          <p>When I’m not crafting delightful experiences for kickass clients, I’m probably out swing dancing! I teach Lindy Hop and swing dancing around CT, and I run a nonprofit dance organization in Chicago with a few of my friends!
